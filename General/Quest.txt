Turn In Quest Items

/run SelectGossipAvailableQuest(1); CompleteQuest(); GetQuestReward();

Use: This is usable at almost any quest giver with a blue question mark. Itâ€™s especially useful for doing Dark Iron Residue turn ins for Thorium Brotherhood faction. Some of these quest givers offer multiple quests. To have the macro select a quest besides the first one, simply change the number in the parentheses.
